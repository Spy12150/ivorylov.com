    title: "On AI Coding",
    date: "August 7, 2025",
    content: `I think the rise of AI coding is one of the greatest things to happen to the software industry. It dramatically lowered the technical requirement for a developer to make great projects. It also removed a big chunk of the technical gap between an experienced coder and someone who barely knows how to code. For me, it broke down the barrier of having to read complicated docs and remember syntax and instead cuts straight to the "building" part of programming.

However, as a new technology comes along, people warn to not be reliant on it and still learn complicated data structures or new language syntax. To that, I disagree:

When high level languages came along, most programmers were no longer required to understand or write in assembly. Today only a very small percentage of people still work in asm, and that number will only continue to shrink.

I don't see dependence on AI code as a long term time bomb. AI coding is advancing at incredible pace and I don't see that progress stopping. If anything, I see the ability to code as a short term skill that is becoming more obsolete by day. Knowing how to add or multiply many large numbers quickly isn't a needed skill today because computer do it at 10000x speeds than it is possible for humans. Coding skills are still valuable today as even the best coding agents are still making errors and have limited context, but I believe in the near future code agents will produce better code than 90-95% of trained programmers, and eventually that number could reach 100%.

I think the skills that will become more relevant are project management skills, and how well you communicate with humans as well as machine. It is more important to start utilizing this new tool and learn how to become more efficient with it, rather than learning those skills that will be replaced by this new tool.`,
